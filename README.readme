Cypress Test Automation Project
This repository contains the test automation framework built using Cypress for end-to-end testing of the application.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)
npm (comes with Node.js)
A package manager like npm or yarn
Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copiar cÃ³digo
git clone https://github.com/techlabs-be-devgit/qa-automation.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Install dependencies
Once in the project directory, install all dependencies by running:

bash

npm install
or if you use yarn:

bash

yarn install
3. Run tests
To execute tests, run the following command:

bash

npx cypress open
This will open the Cypress Test Runner, allowing you to run specific tests interactively.

Alternatively, to run tests in headless mode, use:

bash

npx cypress run
Project Structure
cypress/fixtures: Test data files (e.g., JSON, CSV).
cypress/integration: Test files (specs) go here.
cypress/plugins: Cypress plugins.
cypress/support: Helper functions and commands for reuse across tests.
Writing Tests
Tests are located in the cypress/integration directory. Here's a basic example of a Cypress test:

javascript

describe('My First Test', () => {
  it('Visits the homepage and verifies the title', () => {
    cy.visit('https://example.com')
    cy.title().should('include', 'Example Domain')
  })
})
Running in CI
To integrate Cypress into a Continuous Integration (CI) environment, you can use the following command to run tests in headless mode:

bash

npx cypress run
Make sure to configure your CI pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI) to use this command.

Troubleshooting
Ensure Node.js and Cypress are installed correctly.
If tests fail, check the test runner logs for detailed error messages.
For specific error messages, refer to the Cypress documentation.
